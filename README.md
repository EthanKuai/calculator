# calculator

A simple calculator accepting a string input and spits out the results

### Motivation

I have always wanted to produce a simple calculator-string parser. I plan to improve this in the future by adding a GUI and improving it to store variables and perform numerical calculus.

# Features

A command shell input/output. Accepts basic arithimetics, brackets, e, pi, and trigonometric expressions.

# Dependencies

+ [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/)

### Installation

	git clone https://github.com/EthanKuai/calculator.git

# Usage
## Command Shell

Forever waits for input. Input accepts any number of mathematical expressions to calculate, separated by `;`. Type "quit" to exit.

*! Will do full list in the future*
